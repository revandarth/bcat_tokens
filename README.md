# Security Token Smart Contract

This repository is designed to develop a securities tokens using solidity smart contract that provide a platform for launching regulatory-compliant token sale on Ethereum. The repository is heavly relies on OpenZeppelin standards which provide us with added security benefit, since the OpenZeppelin library is community vetted for security vulnerabilities.


## Getting Started

## Node JS environment Setup

$ node -v

## Truffle

$ npm install -g truffle
P.S: If you are following this, you need  @4.1.11
$ truffle version

Install Ganache
$ npm install -g ganache-cli

OpenZeppelin integrates with [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle) 

## Truffle

To use with Truffle, first install it and initialize your project with `truffle init`.

```
sh 
mkdir bcat_tokens && cd bcat_tokens
truffle init
```

## Installing OpenZeppelin

After installing truffle, to install the OpenZeppelin library, run the following in your Solidity project root directory:

```
sh
npm init -y
npm install -E openzeppelin-solidity
```

**Note that OpenZeppelin does not currently follow semantic versioning.** You may encounter breaking changes upon a minor version bump. We recommend pinning the version of OpenZeppelin you use, as done by the `-E` (`--save-exact`) option.
